This will be / is the Github Repository for Aeon Showmix Betas.
It mainly exists for easy update access between me and andyblac.

you CAN download anything you find here, but be aware of the following:

- there will be NO SUPPORT AT ALL for beta versions.
- By downloading you agree that you will only use it in private, only
  for testing purposes and you will NOT redistribute what you will find here.
  
(Support might be given to a closed user group, though. if we decide you should
participate in the beta testing phase, you will be contacted by us.)

cheers
